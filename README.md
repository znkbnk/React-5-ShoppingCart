Step 1: Set up the project

Create a new React project using Create React App or any other boilerplate.
Install React Router if you haven't already:

Step 2: Create the Item component

Create a new file Item.js in the 'components' folder.
Implement the Item component that represents a single item in the shopping cart.
The Item component should display the item name, price, quantity, and buttons for increment, decrement, and remove.

Step 3: Create the ShoppingCart component

Create a new file ShoppingCart.js in the 'components' folder.
Implement the ShoppingCart component that acts as the container for the shopping cart.
The ShoppingCart component should keep track of the list of items in the cart using React state.

Step 4: Implement the remove item handler

In ShoppingCart.js, add a handler function handleRemoveItem that removes an item from the cart when the remove button in the Item component is clicked.
The handler should update the state to remove the selected item from the list.

Step 5: Implement the increment and decrement handlers

In ShoppingCart.js, add handler functions handleIncrementItem and handleDecrementItem that handle the increment and decrement operations when the corresponding buttons in the Item component are clicked.
The handlers should update the item's quantity in the state accordingly.

Step 6: Display the total price

In ShoppingCart.js, add a section to display the total price of all items in the cart.
Calculate the total price based on the quantity and price of each item in the cart using the calculateTotalPrice function.

Step 7: Create the Checkout component

Create a new file Checkout.js in the 'components' folder.
Implement the Checkout component that represents the checkout page.
This component can include a checkout form, shipping details, and other information.

Step 8: Set up routing

In App.js, import the BrowserRouter, Route, Switch, and other components from react-router-dom.
Add the navigation links for Home (Shopping Cart) and Checkout.
Set up the routes for the ShoppingCart and Checkout components.

Step 9: Styling

Create a new file styles.css in the 'src' folder and add basic styling to the components.
Import the CSS file into App.js to apply the styles to the entire app.

Step 10: Test the app

Run the development server and test the app to ensure that all buttons and handlers work as expected.
Test different scenarios like adding items, removing items, incrementing/decrementing quantities, etc.
